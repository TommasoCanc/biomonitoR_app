<h3>What is biomonitoR?</h3>
<br>
<b><i>biomonitoR</i></b> is a package for the R programming language that fills a gap in the range of informatic tools for calculating and managing biological and ecological data. <br>
To date, <i><b>biomonitoR</i></b> implements most of the biological indices (both taxonomic and functional based) currently used, tested, or just proposed in different fields of ecology and freshwater science. 
Its easy-to-use design favors the flow of information that is currently often fragmented in specific country methods, national protocols and informatic programs. <br>
<br>
<i><b>biomonitoR </i></b> represents a flexible toolbox that allows to: <br>
<b>i)</b> check taxonomy, sensitivity, and biological and ecological traits against updated reference datasets; <br>
<b>ii)</b> manage datasets composed by a heterogeneous taxonomic resolution simplifying the calculation of wide set of biological indices using different taxonomic levels; <br>
<b>iii)</b> calculate metrics for broad and stressor-specific ecological assessment; <br>
<b>iv)</b> provide several data visualization options helping decision-making processes and result dissemination. <br>
