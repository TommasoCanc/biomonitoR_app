<h1>biomonitoR App</h1>

<b><i>biomonitoR App</b></i> is the interactive and user-friendly version of the <b><i>biomonitoR</b></i> package. Thanks to the <b><i>biomonitoR App</b></i> is possible to manage your datasets, check and correct the nomenclature of your taxa and easily calculate several biological and ecological indices.

<h3>What is biomonitoR?</h3>

<i><b>biomonitoR</b></i> is a package for the R programming language that fills a gap in the range of informatic tools for the management and visualization of ecological data. <i><b>biomonitoR</b></i> implements most of the biological indices currently used or proposed in different fields of ecology and aquatic science. Its easy-to-use design favours the flow of information that is often fragmented in specific country methods, national protocols and informatic programs.

<br>
<br>

<i><b>biomonitoR</b></i> currently allows the calculation of more than 30 indices (including diversity, biomonitoring <i>sensu stricto</i> and functional measures) as well as a wide range of further taxonomic indices (e.g., richness or abundance of a particular taxon, pair and combination of taxa).

<br>
<br>

It represents a flexible toolbox with five main assets:
<ul>
    <li>it checks taxonomic information against reference databases allowing for customization of trait and sensitivity scores;</li>
    <li>it supports heterogeneous taxonomic resolutions allowing computations at multiple taxonomic levels;</li>
    <li>it calculates multiple biological indices, including metrics for both general and stressor-specific ecological assessments;</li>
    <li>it enables powerful data visualization, helping both decision-making processes and result dissemination;</li>
    <li>it also allows to work with a user-friendly web application straight from R (biomonitoR App).</li>
</ul>
